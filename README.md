# NukeNotes

The particular nuances of nuke
are difficult to call to mind
when moving from one studio to another
leaving developed code behind

With societies 'protections'
forcing ownership endowed;
taking notes, surely this
is reasonably still allowed.

tldr: notes and snippets about how to do various things in nuke.
